Cognitive remediation tool designed for the general public.

## Description

Cognitive remediation is a form of therapy aimed at reducing the impact of cognitive difficulties on a patient's daily life. These difficulties are first objectively identified through a neuropsychological assessment.

There are two main approaches to cognitive remediation. The first involves intensive training of the impaired function (for example, practicing learning new information in cases where the patient has memory problems).

The second approach focuses on bypassing the difficulty by developing compensatory strategies that rely on the patient’s preserved abilities (for example, writing down information to remember it, using mnemonic devices, etc.).

This tool targets the second approach. Its goal is to provide an easy-to-access platform that supports you throughout your entire cognitive remediation journey.
